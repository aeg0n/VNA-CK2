# VNA-CK2
Verba Non Acta - A CK2 Mod

## Features

Ultimate aim of this mod is to add cultural titles to all of the cultures. And that includes adding cultural names for different Kingdoms and Empires. 

As of now most of the work is focused on Europe with exception of the Celtics and the Greeks. We will get them in future builds. 

Other than that, It also gives you the option when playing as Holy Roman Emperor to designate "Prince Electors" (It is just a minor title as all de-jure Dukes of HRE act as Prince Electors in game). 

## How to use

Navigate to your mod directory:

- Windows: `~\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Crusader Kings II\mod\`

- Linux: `~/.paradoxinteractive/Crusader Kings II/mod/`

- Mac: `~/Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod/`

And paste the "verbanonactamod" folder and "verbanonactamod.mod" file in your mod directory. 

## Compatibility

Theoretically it should run with every mod which doesn't replace the vanilla cultures.

## Known bugs

1. Hungarian and Finnish Special Characters causing issues while displaying due to some font limitation. Fixed as of now by replacing the exclusive letters with their English counterparts, might have caused some gramattical issues.

2. Some Czech letters had to be replaced with English counterparts, might have caused some gramattical issues. 

3. Vanilla Localiztion for Russian Dukes and Anglo-Saxon Counts is for some reason overriding the Mod's localization, which essentially means that they are still called Grand Princes and Earls.

4. Nomenclature of Karling held special Kingdoms like Germany/East Francia, France/West Francia, Lotharingia/Middle Francia is shaky in Charlemagne and subsequent starts.
